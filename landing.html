        Pain is an important part of being human, but we don’t have to live with it on a daily basis. 
        Pain has evolved with our biology as a useful tool to keep us safe and free from harm. It 
        teaches us, in the form of a physically felt experience, what in our outer world is safe 
        and what is dangerous. Pain a response to a signal or queue from our environment that something 
        in which we’re engaging with may be threatening to our safety. Experiencing pain (for example: 
        when you touch a hot pan) allows us to learn how to behave safely when the next time comes around.
      </div>

      <div id="brain" class="bodyHead">Pain and the Brain</div>
      <div class="bodyDisc">
        The experience of pain is a dynamic between a person and their environment, and within this dynamic, 
        the brain plays a very important role. As mentioned earlier, the pain pathways in the brain are 
        developmentally important to human survival and safety, however, chronic pain can be an interpretation 
        of the brain that our environment is fundamentally dangerous or threatening to us. This also is not 
        purely limited to your physical environment, but your emotional and social environment can also set 
        off stress and eventually pain mechanisms in the body. 

        <br><br>

        However, sometimes the brain will misinterpret the environment, or the body will misinterpret the brain. 
        Sometimes, we are fed the same information over and over again from our environment that we take it to be true. 
        Whatever it is, the happenings of our lives don’t simply pass us by. Everything that you interact with gets 
        processed by the brain and integrated into your biology. We call these things “happenings” because they 
        come and go. Some last longer than others, and some come and leave within a matter of minutes or seconds. 
        For example, if you and your friend are walking down the street, and you like admiring trees but your friend 
        likes admiring buildings, while you are going for the same walk, the trees last longer in your awareness then 
        the buildings do, and vice versa for your friend. Certain experiences can be more sticky in your awareness than 
        others, all of this is natural and what it is can vary from person to person.

      <div id="coding" class="bodyHead">Predictive Coding</div>
      <div class="bodyDisc">
        Here's an example: let's say you twist your ankle and experience bad pain, the pain is very intense and makes 
        a firm impression on your awareness. The thought and feeling of pain becomes sticky in your brain. From there 
        on our, you move cautiously through your life, as to not trigger the pain in your ankle. After a few weeks, 
        your ankle has healed! However, you have made it a practice to move carefully, and your brain has become 
        accustomed to expecting and avoiding pain. While the source of the pain may have resolved itself, your brain is 
        not able to tell the difference between the signal of expecting pain and an external signal that causes such pain. 
        Since the pain pathway is already paved, and you send a lot of energy in and around that pathway, even with the 
        good intention to NOT trigger pain, the road maintenance is top notch because the impression is so sticky.

        <div id="spacer"></div>
        <div id="flow" class="bodyHead">Flow States</div>
        <div class="bodyDisc">
          The best way to pave a new road in the brain is to be fully immersed in the task you have at hand, and ideally, 
          they are simple and repetitive motions that are stimulating, but not too challenging or too dull. Ideally, this 
          is something that you enjoy doing such as drawing, driving, or gardening, but this state of immersive flow can
            also be accessed through activities in your daily life like chopping vegetables or washing dishes. These are 
            helpful practices because 1. They involve the body and keep you in the body 2. The repetition acts like a 
            metronome, locking you in time as the moment unfolds. These practices act like a container, holding you in time 
            at the brink of the present as it is unfolding. As you are in this flow, the moment has a newness and a freshness 
            to it, and since you are locked in the moment, the usual patterns of expectation and prediction in your brain are 
            not firing.

        <div id="spacer"></div>
        <div id="nature" class="bodyHead">Reconnecting with Nature</div>
        <div class="bodyDisc">
          Setting the intention and time to connect with nature is an extremely fruitful practice. While it is amazing to have 
          a vast mountainous range with tall trees and running rivers, nature is in fact all around us! It is equally effective 
          to set aside 15 undistracted minutes (as often as you can) to sit on your front steps or balcony and listen to the 
          birds, watch the trees sway, watch the squirrels run about, or watch the little spider on your railing. Even if you 
          are in a big city, you can take some time to sit with the little weed growing through the sidewalk, or look out your 
          window at the vast horizon of land and buildings. Of course, the bustling city life is still a work of nature!
          The fruits of this practice take on a wide range. If you are totally not engaged, but still sit outside, the sounds of 
          birds chirping calm the body and signal that it is safe, since birds don't chirp and chatter when there is a predator 
          around. However, after building a practice of sitting outside, you may start to realize that birds speak many languages. 
          When the birds are in danger, they make a sound some call the bird “alarm”, and this sounds very different from the 
          usual chitter. While it may seem like an irrelevant thing to learn, sitting in nature and listening to the language 
          of your local birds is the perfect gateway into knitting a deep connection with nature. For example, maybe you're at 
          work or on your lunch break, and hear the familiar danger-call (bird alarm) that the birds by your house make. You 
          recognise it! This small awareness pulls you out of the stress and intensity of being a working human, and you remember 
          that there are other beings out there also going through their day of gathering berries and hiding from predators. These 
          types of small practices, like simply sitting out in nature can make happiness and inner clarity (healing) habitual. You 
          return to work, but with more perspective and understanding that you and others that you work with all similarly emerged 
          from the energy of the sun, water, earth, and forces of nature. Connection with nature encourages a more lighthearted 
          perspective. 

          <br><br>
          
          Pain is an emotional experience and can be accompanied with sleep issues, anxiety, and depression. The 
          healing effect of nature on the body can be showcased for instance from the forest therapy study, where a pool of 
          individuals coping with chronic pain that was “present for three months or more in at least five tender points" 
          were placed in the program. During this two day program, participants engaged in indoor and outdoor activities at the 
          camp. The results displayed “significant increase in some measures of heart rate variability and an increase in immune 
          competence as indicated by natural killer cell activity. Participants in the forest therapy group also reported 
          significant decreases in pain and depression”. Being in the forest physically relaxes your body and soothes your 
          anxiety as you immerse yourself in the natural surroundings. Being in this mindful place and doing an activity,
          something as simple as a stretch can reduce the intensity with which you perceive pain.

        It will take you work, but you can be free! Emotionally and pain free. [gone within four months for me]. I suffered 
        recurring back pain and sciatica [lasting one year], which was getting worse each episode. First, I had it bad in the 
        AM, [a] year later AM was fine [then] PM was awful. I was like this does not make any sense. I stumbled on [it]. Today 
        I am doing the MOST hard gym exercises including squats and deadlifts, with no fear.

        For me, a healthy 21 year old female who used to be a competitive athlete, I began to experience pain almost daily 
        after being in an auto accident. While the doctors concluded I no longer have any structural sources for pain, it 
        still endures? After lots of therapy and reflection, I’m revealing that the pain is sticky in my brain because it is 
        playing out certain belief systems and narratives I’ve collected throughout my childhood and life. While I would love 
        not to experience pain on the daily, my old belief systems seem to! For me, it was easier to believe there is something
         wrong with me than to take full accountability for my life and actions. While it is difficult to have real physical 
         pain be the teacher, it has revealed deeper parts of myself that I must hold space for and integrate on the path to 
         becoming whole after traumatic experiences.

        I've had headaches most of my life, and remember them becoming a bit more consistent/intense around age 25 (I'm currently 35). 
        At this point they're 2-3x weekly and bad, sometimes i'm in bed with an eye mask on for the whole day or more, taking lots of 
        ibuprofen, caffeine pills, excedrin migraine and occasional sumatriptan.  5 days in, I started to have a headache near my 
        right temple. I did as advised and focused on my thoughts/emotions rather than anything physical, and I also said to my brain 
        'I know what you're doing and it's not going to work, now give me oxygen and open up my blood vessels near my temple', and 
        the headache went away.  I had maybe 1 headache that week, and then from that point forward, roughly 1 mild headache per 
        month. You might be caught in a fear-pain cycle and be digging yourself in deeper looking for a physical solution.
